      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Your roof is one of the most important parts of your home or business. It protects you from rain, wind, and heat. But when problems appear, ignoring them can lead to costly damage. In Columbia, SC, <a href="https://downtoearthroofingllc.com/">Down To Earth Roofing</a> has helped many property owners spot issues early and fix them before they get worse. This guide explains the top 10 warning signs that your roof needs immediate repair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>1. Missing or Damaged Shingles</h2>
      <p>If you notice shingles that are cracked, curled, or missing, it’s time to act. Shingles protect your roof from water damage. Without them, leaks can form quickly. Professional <a href="https://downtoearthroofingllc.com/shingle-roof-installation-repair/">shingle roof repair services</a> can restore your roof’s strength.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>2. Water Leaks Inside the Home</h2>
      <p>Water stains on ceilings or walls are clear signs of roof leaks. Even small leaks can cause mold and structural damage. <a href="https://downtoearthroofingllc.com/residential-commercial-roofing/">Residential and commercial roofing experts</a> in Columbia can inspect and repair leaks before they spread.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>3. Sagging Roof Deck</h2>
      <p>A sagging roof deck often means trapped moisture or weakened support beams. This is a serious issue that requires immediate attention. Contacting <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=down+to+earth+roofing+&sca_esv=e8e2a5668189fd76">Down To Earth Roofing’s Google Business Profile</a> makes it easy to schedule an inspection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>4. Damaged Flashing</h2>
      <p>Flashing protects areas where the roof meets walls or chimneys. If flashing is cracked or rusted, water can seep in. <a href="https://downtoearthroofingllc.com/chimney-repair/">Chimney repair services</a> often include fixing flashing to prevent leaks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>5. Granules in Gutters</h2>
      <p>Shingle granules help protect against UV rays. If you see lots of granules in your gutters, your shingles may be wearing out. This is a sign your roof may need replacement or repair.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>6. Rising Energy Bills</h2>
      <p>A damaged roof can let air escape, making your heating and cooling systems work harder. If your energy bills are climbing, it may be time to check your roof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>7. Mold or Moss Growth</h2>
      <p>Moss and mold hold moisture against your roof, which can weaken shingles and wood. Regular cleaning and repair prevent long-term damage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>8. Interior Light Through the Roof</h2>
      <p>If you see daylight coming through your attic roof boards, it means gaps exist. These gaps can let in water and pests. Immediate repair is needed to keep your home safe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>9. Storm Damage</h2>
      <p>Strong winds and heavy rain in Columbia can damage roofs quickly. After storms, always inspect your roof or call <a href="https://downtoearthroofingllc.com/flat-roof-installation-repair/">flat roof installation and repair specialists</a> for help.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <h2>10. Age of the Roof</h2>
      <p>Most roofs last 20–25 years. If your roof is older, it may need replacement even if problems aren’t visible yet. Regular inspections from <a href="https://downtoearthroofingllc.com/">Down To Earth Roofing</a> can give you peace of mind.</p>
